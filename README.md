# Building Menu Snappr

*Menu Snappr* was written in a combination of Perl, AppleScript, and shell commands and built with [Platypus](https://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus).

To build it:

1. Download and install Platypus
2. Use the included **Menu Snappr.platypus** profile and replace the existing script path with a local copy of **menu_cap.pl**
3. Include all of the various .PNG images and the **en_resource.def** file as part of the Platypus app bundle

Have fun!
